Hi guys. This is Harshal Gupta. I am 21 years old, a student of Bachelors in Engineering in Computers somewhere in India. Being a final year student does make you aware of the stark realities of the industry you are about to step in and it also kind of pushes you out of your little nest where everything was sweeter than honey.

 So as a target of getting a **respectable** full time job in the industry by **May 2016**, I am here to learn how to code - _efficiently_ and also take a look  at projects inside the **GitHub world** and try to participate in them. 


I'll mainly be using this blog to keep a digital log of my daily learnings along with a few posts on the different quirks of various languages I go through and what not. 

Maybe, this will help me stay on the path and not deviate. 

Let's just hope for the best.

Thank you for reading.


Cheers!
