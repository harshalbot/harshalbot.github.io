First of all, apologies for missing the last couple updates. Changing cities and moving got in the way of things. Anyway, here I am. Lets get started.

The E-commerce sales have ended and the focus is now on the numbers(inflated?) being reported by each of the giants. With the winter slowly creeping up on and Diwali in the eye-sights, lets hope the festival brings some good news for the ecosystem.

Anyway, going back to our small little startup world:

**RIP**

This section is dedicated to those who couldn’t make it. Those who tried, but failed. Those who raised, but burned. Those who stood, but had to sit.

* No news so far about a startup closing doors. A good news maybe.
