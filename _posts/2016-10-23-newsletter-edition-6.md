One of the biggest mergers in the Indian Startup Ecosystem took place this week. MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, came together to form a $1.6 Billion entity, ruffling feathers all around. GoIbibo, bakced by the South African behemoth, Naspers and MMT, backed by various companies, specifically CTrip form China joined hands in a no cash-all equity deal.  Time to sit back and see what this effect has on the ecosystem as a whole and the travel space especially?

Heading to the snippets of the week:
